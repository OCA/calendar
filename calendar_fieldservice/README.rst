This module synchronizes FSM Orders and Calendar events mapping the following fields:

FSM Order to Calendar Event
-------------------------------
scheduled_date_start to start
scheduled_date_end to stop
duration to duration

When an FSM Order is created, a corresponding Calendar Event is created as well. When you edit any 
of the fields above, the corresponding change will be reflected on the other object. When you delete 
an FSM Order, the Calendar Event will be deleted, if you delete the Calendar Event, it will log 
a message in the Chatter letting the Dispatcher know the Calendar Event was deleted and who is was 
deleted by.

Calendar Events that have been synced to Google Calendar
(in other words, there is a google_id assigned to the calendar.event), can not be deleted, only archived.
In Calendar View, there is no Archive button, only a Delete button, so the users are stuck with not being able to delete a Google Calendar-synced Calendar Event.
This module automatically redirects the delete (unlink) command to instead archive records that already have a google_id.

This module allows administrator to configure which events will be synchronized from Odoo to Outlook:

* **All events** option (by default) keeps *microsoft_calendar* current behaviour
* **Only future events** option synchronizes only future events
* **No events** option no sync from Odoo to Outlook (only gets events from outlook)

This module is manly written to avoid Outlook spamming when modifying (old) events. See https://www.odoo.com/documentation/14.0/applications/general/calendars/outlook/outlook_calendar.html

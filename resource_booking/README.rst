This module adds a new app to allow you to book resource combinations in given
schedules.

Example use cases:

* Management of consultations in a clinic.
* Salesman appointments.
* Classroom and projector reservations.
* Hotel room booking.

Among the things you can do:

* Specify the type of booking, which includes a calendar of availability.
* Specify which resources can be booked together. All of them must be free to be booked.
* Place pending bookings, effectively giving permissions to someone to see the availability calendar and choose one slot.
* Partners can do that from their portals.
* If a partner has no user, he can still do the same via a tokenized URL.
* Backend users can also do that from the backend.
* Booking lifecycle with computed states.
* Automatic meeting creation and deletion.
* Automatic conflict detection.
* Deadline to block modifications.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to install these dependencies:

#. `freezegun <https://github.com/spulec/freezegun>`__
#. `web_calendar_slot_duration <https://odoo-community.org/shop/product/calendar-slot-duration-6202>`__

When someone is a manager, he will have access to *Resource Bookings >
Configuration*, where he will be able to configure resources, leaves and
schedules. This menu is just provided as a shortcut. However, if you want to
manage that stuff more comfortably:

* To manage human resources, install `hr <https://apps.odoo.com/app/employees>`__.
* To manage their leaves, install `hr_holidays <https://apps.odoo.com/app/time-off>`__.
* To manage work centers, install `mrp <https://apps.odoo.com/app/manufacturing>`__.

Configuration
=============

To let some backend user to book resources:

#. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Users*.
#. Pick or create one.
#. Assign *Resource Booking > User*.

To let some backend user to configure types and combinations, and to be able to
modify overdue bookings:

#. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Users*.
#. Pick or create one.
#. Assign *Resource Booking > Manager*.

To configure one booking type:

#. Go to *Resource Bookings > Types*.
#. Create one.
#. Give it a *name*.
#. Set the *Duration*, to know the time assigned to each calendar slot.
#. Set the *Modifications Deadline*, to forbid non-managers to alter dates of
   a booking when it's too late.
#. Choose one *Availability Calendar*. No bookings will exist outside of it.
#. Under *Meeting defaults*, you will be able to fill some values that will
   be used by default on calendar meetings. These will appear in the global
   calendar when some booking is reserved.
#. Choose some *Available resource combinations*. All combinations in the same
   line must be free to be booked together; otherwise the booking will not be
   able to be scheduled. You can sort them.
#. Pick up one *Combination Assignment*. If you choose *Sorted*, then the order
   of the combinations you chose will indicate the one that is selected first.
   Of course, it must be free to be selected.
#. Save.

Usage
=====

This module installs a new app, "Resource bookings".

Bookings may involve you:

* Maybe because you requested to book something.
* Maybe because you are one of the booked resources, if a booking represents
  some kind of appointment.

To see which bookings involve you:

#. Go to *Resource Bookings > Bookings*.
#. You can switch to the list view if you need to see also the pending ones.
#. You can remove the "Involving me" filter if you want to see others' bookings.

To book some resources:

#. Go to *Resource Bookings > Types*.
#. Pick the type of booking you want.
#. Click on *Booking Count*.
#. Click on a free slot.
#. Fill the *Requester*, which may or not be yourself.
#. Pick one *Resources combination*, in case the one assigned automatically
   isn't the one you want.

To invite someone to book a resource combination from the portal:

#. Go to *Resource Bookings > Types*.
#. Pick the type of booking you want.
#. Click on *Booking Count*.
#. Click on the list view icon.
#. Click on *Create*.
#. Fill the *Requester*.
#. Pick one *Resources combination*, if you want that the requester is assigned
   to that combination. Otherwise, leave it empty, and some free combination
   will be assigned automatically when the requester picks a free slot.
#. Click on *Share > Send*.
#. The requester will receive an email to select a calendar slot from his portal.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Allow combination auto-assignment based on least used combination.
* Allow customer to choose combination.
* Some error messages would be a bit more helpful if they specify the schedule
  impossibility reason, but that should be done without affecting performance.
* Optimize ``_calendar_event_busy_intervals()`` to make it work in batch.

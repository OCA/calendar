This module adds a new app to allow you to book resource combinations in given
schedules.

Example use cases:

* Management of consultations in a clinic.
* Salesman appointments.
* Classroom and projector reservations.
* Hotel room booking.

Among the things you can do:

* Specify the type of booking, which includes a calendar of availability.
* Specify which resources can be booked together. All of them must be free to be booked.
* Place pending bookings, effectively giving permissions to someone to see the availability calendar and choose one slot.
* Partners can do that from their portals.
* If a partner has no user, he can still do the same via a tokenized URL.
* Backend users can also do that from the backend.
* Booking lifecycle with computed states.
* Automatic meeting creation and deletion.
* Automatic conflict detection.
* Deadline to block modifications.

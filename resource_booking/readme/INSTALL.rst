When someone is a manager, he will have access to *Resource Bookings >
Configuration*, where he will be able to configure resources, leaves and
schedules. This menu is just provided as a commodity. However, if you want to
manage that stuff more comfortably:

* To manage human resources, install `hr <https://apps.odoo.com/app/employees>`__.
* To manage their leaves, install `hr_holidays <https://apps.odoo.com/app/time-off>`__.
* To manage work centers, install `mrp <https://apps.odoo.com/app/manufacturing>`__.

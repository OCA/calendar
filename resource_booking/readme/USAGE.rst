This module installs a new app, "Resource bookings".

Bookings may involve you:

* Maybe because you requested to book something.
* Maybe because you are one of the booked resources, if a booking represents
  some kind of appointment.

To see which bookings involve you:

#. Go to *Resource Bookings > Bookings*.
#. You can switch to the list view if you need to see also the pending ones.
#. You can remove the "Involving me" filter if you want to see others' bookings.

To book some resources:

#. Go to *Resource Bookings > Types*.
#. Pick the type of booking you want.
#. Click on *Booking Count*.
#. Click on a free slot.
#. Fill the *Requester*, which may or not be yourself.
#. Pick one *Resources combination*, in case the one assigned automatically
   isn't the one you want.

To invite someone to book a resource combination from the portal:

#. Go to *Resource Bookings > Types*.
#. Pick the type of booking you want.
#. Click on *Booking Count*.
#. Click on the list view icon.
#. Click on *Create*.
#. Fill the *Requester*.
#. Pick one *Resources combination*, if you want that the requester is assigned
   to that combination. Otherwise, leave it empty, and some free combination
   will be assigned automatically when the requester picks a free slot.
#. Click on *Share > Send*.
#. The requester will receive an email to select a calendar slot from his portal.

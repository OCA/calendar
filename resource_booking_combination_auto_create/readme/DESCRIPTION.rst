This module allows to create bookable resource combinations automatically as
needed.

It allows to define resource categories and link them to resources.
On bookings, it provides a wizard to select or create a resource combination:

1. Select resource categories.
2. This searches for matching available resources and displays them.
3. Select the individual resources to book.
4. The corresponding combination is created (or selected if it exists
   already), added to the booking type and selected for the booking.
